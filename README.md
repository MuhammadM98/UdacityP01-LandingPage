# UdacityP01-LandingPage
Project #01 of the Udacity Web Development Professional Nandodegree Offered by the egFWD intiative

### Objective
Making a predesigned static page by udacity and turning it into a dynamic one.

### Outlines
- Adding a dynamic navigation bar that automatically includes the page sections.
- Adding a top button that returns to the top of the page when clicked.
- Top button should be hidden when the top of the site is already in the viewport.
- The current section in viewport should have it's link in the navigation menu highlighted.

### Structure
 index.html

 css
 styles.css

 js
 app.js

### My Approach
 I found a solution online to have insights of what should I do as I didn't fully unsderstand the objectives from the the udacity guide, thanks udacity for offering this way.
 I tried to study the code and understand why eachcode is placed in it's specific place.
 Studying the code made me have a better understanding of what should I do.
 I started coding my page and had a lot of mistakes at first , done a lot of refactoring.
 Declared the variables first
 I tried to finish the functions on one selected section at first, making sure it works (Scrolling , Active class is highlighted in the nav).
 Then made the funcitons global and dynamic so it can work with any number of sections added.
 At last was the easy pary of making the back to top button.
